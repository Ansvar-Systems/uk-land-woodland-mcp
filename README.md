UK land and woodland management regulations via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Query hedgerow regulations, felling licences, SSSI consent, public rights of way, common land rules, and woodland planting guidance -- all from your AI assistant.

Part of [Ansvar Open Agriculture](https://ansvar.eu/open-agriculture).

## Why This Exists

Landowners, farmers, and land agents need to check regulatory requirements before managing hedgerows, felling trees, working on SSSIs, or planting woodland. These rules are spread across multiple Acts of Parliament, statutory instruments, and Forestry Commission guidance documents. This MCP server brings them together in a single queryable source.

## Example Queries

Ask your AI assistant:

- "Do I need permission to remove a hedgerow?"
- "How much timber can I fell without a licence?"
- "What consent do I need to fertilise an SSSI?"
- "What is the minimum width for a public footpath?"
- "Can I put a fence on common land?"
- "What grants are available for broadleaf woodland planting?"
